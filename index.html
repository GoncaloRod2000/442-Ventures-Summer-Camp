                    <p>
                        Martin Hašek was born in 1969 in Pardubice where he played football and ice hockey from an early age. While his older brother Dominik chose the ice hockey path and later became a legendary goaltender, Martin eventually opted for the pitch and the football.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time, Martin played for Pardubice, Cheb and Liberec before he moved to Sparta Prague, with which he won five Czech league titles. As a defensive midfielder, he combined perfect physical abilities with football skills and appeared for Sparta Prague in the Champions League knock-out round against Real Madrid. He also played for the national team and spent some time of his career in Austria and Russia. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During his active career he graduated from a university in Hradec Králové, earning the title Mgr. in the Physical Education programme. His university pedagogical knowledge and his experience from the pitch came in handy after Martin retired from football. He became a football coach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He acquired the UEFA Pro Licence for coaches in 2008. After coaching the Sparta Prague reserve team and the second-tier team of Sokolov, he joined the first team of Sparta Prague. He was the head coach when the club won the 2009/2010 title under the leadership of manager Jozef Chovanec.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After three seasons with the first team, he became the main methodologist of Sparta youth teams. So he helped raise dozens of footballers who later played in the top Czech league.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2014 he became the coach of the second-tier FK Pardubice and then he moved to Vlašim in the same league. He returned to the first Czech league in 2017 becoming the head coach of Bohemians Prague 1905. First he helped the team to stay up in the top league and in his first full season at the Ďolíček stadium, Bohemians finished seventh, achieving their second-best result since the dissolution of the Czechoslovak league. Under his leadership, Bohemians reached the Czech cup semi-finals in 2019.
